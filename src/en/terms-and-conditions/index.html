            <p class="txt ts-18 tc-gray tw-500">A reference in this Agreement to a “clause” or “Schedule” shall be construed as a reference to, respectively, a
                clause or Schedule of this Agreement, unless the context requires otherwise. References in this Agreement to any
                statute or statutory instrument or Applicable Regulations include any modification, amendment, extension or
                re-enactment thereof. A reference in this Agreement to “document” shall be construed to include any electronic
                document. The masculine includes the feminine and the neuter and the singular includes the plural and vice versa as
                the context admits or requires. Words and phrases defined in the FSC’s Rules and the Applicable Regulations have the

                included in a Schedule in respect of one Transaction shall not preclude a similar clause being expressed or implied

            <p class="txt ts-18 tc-gray tw-500 mt-4"><strong>Rollovers, Interest</strong></p>

            <p class="txt ts-18 tc-gray tw-500">A daily financing charge may apply to each FX/CFD open position at the closing of Paxton Trade Limited trading day as
                regard to that FX/CFD. If such financing charge is applicable, it will either be requested to be paid by Client
                directly to Paxton Trade Limited’s or it will be paid by Paxton Trade Limited’s to Client, depending on the type of
                FX/CFD and the nature of the position Client holds. The method of calculation of the financing charge varies
                according to the type of FX/CFD to which it applies. Moreover, the amount of the financing charge will vary as it is
                linked to current interest rates (such as LIBOR). The financing charge will be credited or debited (as appropriate)
                to Client’s account on the next trading day following the day to which it relates.</p>

            <p class="txt ts-18 tc-gray tw-500">Paxton Trade Limited’s reserves the right to change the method of calculating the financing charge, the financing
                rates and/or the types of FX/CFDs to which the financing charge applies. For certain types of FX/CFDs, a commission
                is payable by Client to open and close FX/CFD positions. Such commission payable will be debited from Client’s
                account at the same time as Paxton Trade Limited’s opens or closes the relevant FX/CFD. Changes in our swap interest
                rates and calculations shall be at our own discretion and without notice. Clients need to always check our website
                for the then current rates charged. Rates may change quickly due to market conditions (changes in interest rates,
                volatility, liquidity etc.) and due to various risk related matters that are at the firm’s sole discretion.</p>

            <p class="txt ts-18 tc-gray tw-500 mt-4"><strong>For MT4 platform:</strong></p>

            <p class="txt ts-18 tc-gray tw-500">The future contract on which a CFD is based has an expiration date, and clients will be able to close their CFD
                positions until this date. In order to insure continuous trading conditions for the client, when a future contract
                that a CFD is based on reaches its maturity, the underlying asset of that CFD will be switched to the next maturity
                of the same futures contract. A calendar of such rollovers is mentioned on the company’s website, section
                “Documentation/Standard Specifications”. For the best interest of the client, rollovers will also be notified in the
                “Internal news” section of the website, at least 5 hours prior to the rollover. A premium will be either added or
                subtracted from the client’s account, based on the difference in prices between the two futures contracts.</p>

            <p class="txt ts-18 tc-gray tw-500">Any open FX/CFD transaction held by Client at the end of the trading day as determined by Paxton Trade Limited or
                over the weekend, shall automatically be rolled over to the next business day so as to avoid an automatic close and
                physical settlement of the transaction. Client acknowledges that when rolling over such transactions to the next
                business day, a premium may be either added or subtracted from Client’s account with respect to such transaction.
                The MT4 platform calculates overnight rollover at 21:00 GMT and the rollover charge/credit is debited or credited to
                and from the trading account. Example: If you sell 1 lot EURUSD, you will pay rollover costs on 100.000 Euro, which
                at the current rate would be $0.017. This rate may vary over time, for actual rates please check the “Standard
                specifications” on our website.</p>

            <p class="txt ts-18 tc-gray tw-500">On Wednesday at 21:00 GMT, overnight rollover fees are multiplied by three (x3) in order to compensate for the
                upcoming weekend. The premium amount shall be determined by Paxton Trade Limited from time to time, in Paxton Trade
                Limited’s absolute discretion. Client hereby authorizes Paxton Trade Limited to add or subtract the premium to or
                from Client ’s account for any open transaction that have accrued a premium, in accordance with the applicable rate
                thereto, each day at the time of collection specified on the trading platform for each individual instrument, as
                applicable.</p>

            <p class="txt ts-18 tc-gray tw-500 mt-4"><strong>Placing of instructions</strong></p>

            <p class="txt ts-18 tc-gray tw-500">You may give us instructions in electronic form through the Paxton Trade Limited Online Trading System. If any
                instructions are received by us by telephone, computer or other medium we may ask you to confirm such instructions
                in writing. We shall be authorized to follow instructions notwithstanding your failure to confirm them in writing.
                In this Agreement “instructions” and “orders” have the same meaning.</p>

            <p class="txt ts-18 tc-gray tw-500 mt-4"><strong>Types of Orders Accepted</strong></p>

            <p class="txt ts-18 tc-gray tw-500">Some of the types of orders Paxton Trade Limited accepts include, but are not limited to:</p>

            <p class="txt ts-18 tc-gray tw-500">a) Good till Cancelled (“GTC”) – An order (other than a market order), that by its terms is effective until filled or
                cancelled by Client. GTC Orders are not automatically cancelled at the end of the Business Day on which they are
                placed.</p>

            <p class="txt ts-18 tc-gray tw-500">b) Limit – An order (other than a market order) to buy or sell the identified market at a specified price. A limit
                order to buy generally will be executed when the ask price equals or falls below the bid price that you specify in
                the limit order. A limit order to sell generally will be executed when the bid price equals or exceeds the ask price
                that you specify in the limit order.</p>

            <p class="txt ts-18 tc-gray tw-500">c) Market- An order to buy or sell the identified market at the current market price that Paxton Trade Limited
                provides via the Online Trading System. An order to buy is executed at the current market ask price and an order to
                sell is executed at the current market bid price.</p>

            <p class="txt ts-18 tc-gray tw-500">d) One Cancels the Other (“OCO”) – An order that is linked to another order. If one of the orders is executed, the
                other will be automatically cancelled.</p>

            <p class="txt ts-18 tc-gray tw-500">e) Stop Loss – A stop loss order is an instruction to buy or sell a market at a price which is worse than the opening
                price of an open position (or worse than the prevailing price when applying the stop loss order to an already open
                position). It can be used to help protect against losses. Please note that because of market gapping, the best
                available price that may be achieved could be materially different to the price set on the stop loss order and as
                such, stop loss orders are not guaranteed to take effect at the price for which they are set.</p>

            <p class="txt ts-18 tc-gray tw-500">f) Trailing Stop – A trailing stop is the same as a stop loss order with the only difference being that, instead of
                setting a price at which the order is activated, the trailing stop order is activated at a fixed distance from the
                market price. For example, if Client has purchased a long open position and the market ask price increases, the
                trailing stop price will also increase and will trail behind the market ask price at the fixed distance set by
                Client. If the market ask price then decreases, the trailing stop price will remain fixed at its last position and
                if the market ask price reaches the trailing stop price, the order will be executed. Please note that because of
                market gapping, the best available price that may be achieved could be materially different to the price set on the
                trailing stop order and as such, trailing stop orders are not guaranteed to take effect at the fixed distance for
                which they are set. Following submission of an order, it is your sole responsibility to remain available for order
                and fill confirmations, and other communications regarding your Account until all open orders are completed.
                Thereafter, you must monitor your Account frequently when you have open positions in the Account.</p>

            <p class="txt ts-18 tc-gray tw-500">Your order shall be valid in accordance with the type and time of the given order, as specified. If the time of
                validity or expiration date/time of the order is not specified, it shall be valid for an indefinite period.</p>

                occurring in between. Gaps can be created by a number of factors including regular buying or selling pressure,
                earning announcements, or any other type of news release. If a market gaps through all orders will be filled on a
                best efforts basis at first available price (not order level).</p>

            <p class="txt ts-18 tc-gray tw-500">If the asset reaches the predetermined rate at precisely 17.00 GMT of the same day, the client becomes eligible to
                receive the payout of up to 500% at the time of the expiration. If, however, the investment is out-of-the-money on
                any day, the trade will stay open and be checked each day to see if the price has reached the predetermined rate
                needed for an in-the-money outcome. The trade will remain open until the Friday, at which point the trade expires.

                in order for the client to receive the payout, the sample price of the underlying asset needs to reach or surpass
                the pre-set target rate only once during the option lifetime. In the event that the price of the underlying asset
                does not reach the predetermined level, the client will not receive any refund and will forfeit the entire amount of
                the investment. Therefore, the amount of profit or risk in this option is preset and known ahead of time.</p>

            <p class="txt ts-18 tc-gray tw-500">The option may only be purchased in units, at the price specified on the site. The options will be sampled (checked
                to verify if they hit the target rates) once a day, at 17.00 GMT, Monday through Friday. Whenever sample rates are
                not published five times during the week, the number of samples will be reduced accordingly.</p>

            <p class="txt ts-18 tc-gray tw-500">The predetermined payout will be transferred to the client’s account on the option expiration date, even if the terms
                of the option have been met prior to the date of expiration.</p>

            <p class="txt ts-18 tc-gray tw-500">This Agreement shall be for the benefit of and binding upon us both and our respective successors and assigns. You

            <p class="txt ts-18 tc-gray tw-500 mt-4"><strong>Rights and remedies</strong></p>

                shall be under no obligation to exercise any right or remedy either at all or in a manner or at a time beneficial to
                you. No failure by us to exercise or delay by us in exercising any of our rights under this Agreement (including any
                Transaction) or otherwise shall operate as a waiver of those or any other rights or remedies. No single or partial
                exercise of a right or remedy shall prevent further exercise of that right or remedy or the exercise of another
                right or remedy.</p>

            <p class="txt ts-18 tc-gray tw-500 mt-4"><strong>Partial invalidity</strong></p>

                the law of any jurisdiction, neither the legality, validity or enforceability of the remaining provisions of this
                Agreement nor the legality, validity or enforceability of such provision under the law of any other jurisdiction
                shall in any way be affected or impaired.</p>

            <p class="txt ts-18 tc-gray tw-500 mt-4"><strong>Governing law</strong></p>

            <p class="txt ts-18 tc-gray tw-500">This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with Mauritius law.</p>

            <p class="txt ts-18 tc-gray tw-500">Each of the parties irrevocably:</p>

            <p class="txt ts-18 tc-gray tw-500">i. agrees for our benefit that the courts of Mauritius shall have jurisdiction to settle any suit, action or other
                proceedings relating to this Agreement (“Proceedings”) and irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of such courts
                (provided that this shall not prevent us from bringing an action in the courts of any other jurisdiction); and</p>

            <p class="txt ts-18 tc-gray tw-500">ii. waives any objection which it may have at any time to the laying of venue of any Proceedings brought in any such
                court and agrees not to claim that such Proceedings have been brought in an inconvenient forum or that such court
                does not have jurisdiction over it.</p>

            <p class="txt ts-18 tc-gray tw-500 mt-4"><strong>Waiver of immunity and consent to enforcement</strong></p>

            <p class="txt ts-18 tc-gray tw-500">You irrevocably waive to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, with respect to yourself and your revenue
                and assets (irrespective of their use or intended use) all immunity on the grounds of sovereignty or other similar
                grounds from suit; jurisdiction of any courts; relief by way of injunction, order for specific performance or for
                recovery of property; attachment of assets (whether before or after judgment); and execution or enforcement of any
                judgment to which you or your revenues or assets might otherwise be entitled in any Proceedings in the courts of any
                jurisdiction and irrevocably agree that you will not claim any immunity in any Proceedings. You consent generally in
                respect of any Proceedings to the giving of any relief or the issue of any process in connection with such
                Proceedings, including, without limitation, the making, enforcement or execution against any property whatsoever
                (irrespective of its use or intended use) of any order or judgment which may be made or given in such Proceedings.
            </p>

            <p class="txt ts-18 tc-gray tw-500 mt-4"><span style="margin-bottom: 3em;">If you are situated outside Mauritius, process by which any Proceedings in
                    Mauritius are begun may be served on you by being delivered to the address in Mauritius nominated by you for
                    this purpose. This does not affect our right to serve process in another manner permitted by law.</span></p>
